## Data
The dataset used for this analysis contains housing data with various features that may affect housing prices, such as location, size, and quality. Ensure you have the data file in the correct directory for the notebook to load and analyze it.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Housing Prices.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Open `Housing Prices.ipynb` to review and execute the code cells.
2. Follow along with the steps, from data loading and exploration to model training and evaluation.

## Modeling Process
The notebook follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset structure, checking for missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting features that improve model performance.
3. **Model Training:** Applying machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices.
4. **Evaluation:** Measuring model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## Results
The final section summarizes the model's performance, showcasing insights from the predictions and highlighting important features that influence housing prices.
